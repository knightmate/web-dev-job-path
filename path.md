**Important - Understand the concept behind the question; don't memorize it**

Certainly! Here's a consolidated version of the JavaScript questions without using code blocks:

JavaScript Problem Solving Questions
1. Currying Function
Input:
function add(a, b) { return a + b; }
curriedAdd = curry(add);

Output:
console.log(curriedAdd(2)(3)); // Should return 5

2. Deep Clone Object
Input:
const obj = { a: 1, b: { c: 2 } };
const clonedObj = deepClone(obj);

Output:
console.log(clonedObj.b.c); // Should print 2

3. Flatten Array
Input:
const arr = [1, [2, [3, 4]], 5];
const flattenedArr = flatten(arr);

Output:
console.log(flattenedArr); // Should print [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

4. Throttle Function
Input:
const throttledFunction = throttle(someFunction, 100);

Output:
// someFunction can only be called once every 100 milliseconds

5. Reverse String
Input:
const str = "hello";
const reversedStr = reverseString(str);

Output:
console.log(reversedStr); // Should print "olleh"

6. Memoization
Input:
const memoizedFunction = memoize(someExpensiveFunction);

Output:
// someExpensiveFunction results are cached for future calls

7. Promise Chain
Input:
promiseChain([promise1, promise2, promise3])
.then(result => console.log(result))
.catch(error => console.error(error));

Output:
// Executes promises sequentially and handles any errors

8. Array Intersection
Input:
const arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const arr2 = [3, 4, 5, 6];
const intersection = findIntersection(arr1, arr2);

Output:
console.log(intersection); // Should print [3, 4]

9. Event Loop Understanding
Input:
// Code demonstrating the event loop

Output:
// Explanation of how the event loop works in JavaScript

10. Closure Example
Input:
function outerFunction() { let count = 0; return function innerFunction() { return ++count; }; }

Output:
const increment = outerFunction();
console.log(increment()); // Should return 1
console.log(increment()); // Should return 2

# Essential React Topics for Job Seekers

## Introduction to React
- What is React?
- Why use React?Indetail explanation

## Setting up React
- Create React App
- Manual Setup

-Can you build eract app without using created-react-app??
-how can you?
-what does create-react-app doing?

## JSX (JavaScript XML)
- Basics of JSX
- JSX vs HTML
- Expressions in JSX
- What jsx get converted to?
  
# rendering in react
- React dom
- How React is getting rendered
- Can we build two react app in one project?

## Components and Props
- Functional Components -why and how?
- Class Components -whats the diff comapred to class?
- Props and PropTypes-
- State and setState()-

## Hooks
-What are hooks?You should know what are they not deifnation
```Yes, the useEffect hook in React can optionally return a cleanup function. This cleanup function is useful for performing any necessary cleanup, such as clearing timers, canceling subscriptions, or cleaning up any side effects when the component is unmounted or before re-running the effect due to a subsequent render```

# React Hooks Example
```javascript
const MyComponent = () => {
  useEffect(() => {
    // This function will run when the component mounts
    console.log('Component mounted');

    // Return a cleanup function
    return () => {
      // This function will run when the component unmounts
      console.log('Component will unmount');
    };
  }, []); // The empty dependency array means this effect runs once when the component mounts

  return <div>Hello, World!</div>;
};
```
- useState
- useEffect- whats does it returns? 
When useEffect gets called again , it first call the return ()=> to 
- useContext
- useRef
- Custom Hooks
 (why we need custom hooks , how to built, whats the diff between customhook and normal funciton , why we have to alwasy use 'use' in cusotmhook , also can we make custom hooook outside react component)

## Component Lifecycle
- Mounting
- Updating
- Unmounting
This is for all - be it class or functainl componentm ,its lifeCyle method


## React Router
- Basic Routing
- Nested Routes
- Route Parameters

## State Management
- Context API
- Redux (Basics)

## Forms in React
- Controlled vs Uncontrolled Components
- Form Validation

## Styling in React
- Inline Styles
- CSS Modules
- Styled-components

## Performance Optimization
- React.memo
- useCallback
- useMemo
- Virtual DOM
- How to Stop child from rendering?
-HOw does it ipact on perofrmace?
-understading referece in js is must for undestading how memo works. 

//just basic
## Testing in React
- Jest
- Testing Library (React Testing Library)




//Just udnersaidn is enough
## Advanced Topics
- Server-Side Rendering (Next.js)
- React Suspense and Lazy Loading
- Error Boundaries
- Portals
- Higher-Order Components (HOCs)

## Best Practices
- Folder Structure
- Naming Conventions
- Code Splitting

## Tools and Libraries
- React DevTools
- ESLint
- Prettier
- Axios (for API calls)

## Deployment
- Deploying to Netlify, Vercel, or AWS
- Environment Variables
